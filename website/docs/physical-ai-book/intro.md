# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the Physical AI Book, an accessible learning resource designed to demystify AI systems that interact with the physical world through robotics, sensors, and real-world applications.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact directly with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI systems must perceive, reason about, and act upon real-world environments. This includes:

- Robots that navigate physical spaces
- Autonomous vehicles that respond to traffic conditions
- Smart sensors that monitor environmental conditions
- Industrial systems that control physical processes
- Assistive technologies that interact with humans in physical space

## Who is this book for?

This book is designed for beginner to intermediate learners who want to understand, implement, and experiment with AI systems that interact with the physical world. We assume you have basic programming knowledge but provide comprehensive introductions to specialized topics in Physical AI.

## What will you learn?

In this book, you will:

- Understand the fundamental concepts of Physical AI
- Learn how AI systems perceive the physical world through various sensors
- Explore how AI systems interact with the physical world through actuators and control systems
- Implement hands-on examples with code that demonstrates core concepts
- Connect Physical AI concepts to real-world applications in robotics and autonomous systems

## Book Structure

The book is organized into chapters and lessons that build upon each other:

- **Chapter 1**: Introduction to Physical AI - Understanding the fundamentals of AI systems that interact with the physical world, including sensors, actuators, and real-world applications

Each lesson includes learning objectives, prerequisites, and hands-on examples that you can run, modify, and experiment with.

## Extended Curriculum

This book serves as an introduction to a comprehensive Physical AI curriculum that includes additional modules:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Middleware for robot control, including ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services, and bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Physics simulation and environment building, including simulating physics, gravity, collisions, and sensor simulation
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - Advanced perception and training using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM and navigation
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - The convergence of LLMs and Robotics, including voice-to-action systems and cognitive planning

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to understand the foundations of Physical AI, then progress through the lessons at your own pace. Each lesson is designed to be self-contained while building upon previous knowledge. After completing the foundational content, continue with the curriculum modules to deepen your understanding of Physical AI systems.
