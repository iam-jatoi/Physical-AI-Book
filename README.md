# 📘 Physical AI Book

A structured, spec-driven book project on **Physical AI** — combining theory, real-world systems, and engineering practices — built using **SpecKitPlus** and **Docusaurus**.

This repository contains:
- Book specifications
- Prompt & research history
- Command-driven workflows
- A documentation website for publishing the book

---

## 🚀 Project Goal

To create a **clear, practical, and well-structured book on Physical AI**, covering:

- Foundations of Physical AI
- Differences between Digital AI vs Physical AI
- Robotics, embodied intelligence, and real-world agents
- Engineering challenges in physical systems
- Real-world applications and case studies

The project follows a **spec-first, documentation-driven approach**.

## 🧠 What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to AI systems that:
- Interact with the **physical world**
- Perceive through sensors
- Act through motors or actuators
- Learn under real-world constraints (noise, latency, physics)

Examples include:
- Robots
- Autonomous vehicles
- Drones
- Smart physical agents
